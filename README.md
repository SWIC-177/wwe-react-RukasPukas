## What is React

From my understanding react is used to get the current state of the user's browser. This allows the User Interface (UI) to display content and set content based on things the user has done, is doing or you are wanting the user to do now. This is done by re-rendering.

> React allows you to use a declarative style of code writing... This allows you to write less code and deal with the more interesting stuff.

I am assuming this is similar to the state function that was in the WWE file.  
You must still avoid mutations.

> React is a state management system.

## Notes

> [!NOTE]
> The .jsx file will contain both HTML and JS  
> Never use document. anything outside of establishing the root.  
> Components should always have a capital letter.
> We do not include braces around the export because it is a default export. This means that the whole purpose of exporting default component is that you are only exporting one particular thing.
> With a default export you can call it whatever you want. You are not destructuring.  
> You cannot use class because this is reserved, you must use className.
